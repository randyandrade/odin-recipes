This was my first personal WebDev project for The Odin Project, and even though I already knew HTML from studying it many many years ago, there were many valuable updated lessons to be learned about the way things have evolved in the world of web programming, even in the basic HTML files. We never used to have to use "lang" or "charset" attributes by default, for example, and we never had a concept of a DOCTYPE. We just started all our files with <html> and went on about our day. :)

I also first had to define, and then tried to implement my own personal commit message conventions, based on the Conventional Commit v1.0 spec. Essentially, the only difference is that I think if you have a ! in the subject, you should also have a "BREAKING CHANGE" footer, and it should not be optional, or vice versa. If one is used, both should be used, just for clarity's sake. But again, this is my personal commit convention spec.
