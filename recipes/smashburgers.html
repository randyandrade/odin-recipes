        <h3 class="title">Description:</h3>
        <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. I prefer to cook these outdoors â€” they grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have everything ready to go!</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3 class="title">Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li class="ingredients">4 hamburger buns</li>
            <li class="ingredients">2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
            <li class="ingredients">1 pound ground chuck beef (80/20 lean)</li>
            <li class="ingredients">4 (6-inch) squares of parchment paper</li>
            <li class="ingredients">4 slices American cheese</li>
            <li class="ingredients">salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li class="ingredients">1/2 cup sliced white or Spanish onion rings</li>
            <li class="ingredients">burger toppings of choice</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3 class="title">Directions:</h3>
        <ol class="directions">
            <li class="directions">Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
            <li class="directions">Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
            <li class="directions">Caramalize the hell out of those onions; set aside, keep warm.</li>
            <li class="directions">Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
            <li class="directions">Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings. Don't forget those onions.</li>
        </ol>
