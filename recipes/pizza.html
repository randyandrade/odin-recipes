        <p>Oh, come on... EVERYBODY likes PIZZA!</p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1-lbs prepared frozen pizza dough ball</li>
            <li>4 ounce prepared pizza sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup thin sliced pepperoni</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Allow frozen dough ball to thaw and rise in a covered floured bowl, about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, knead floured dough ball and stretch across a round 16" pizza screen. Very lightly dust the stretched dough with flour.</li>
            <li>Spread pizza sauce to preference across the top surface of the stretched, floured dough. Ensure you leave 1/2" border uncovered around edge of pizza.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle half the cheese over the pizza sauce, spreading evenly.</li>
            <li>Distribute sliced pepperoni evenly over the cheese and sauce on the stretched dough, then sprinkle the remainder of the Mozzarella cheese over the rest of the toppings on the dough.</li>
            <li>Bake pizza on screen in the oven for 12-15 minutes, watching for the cheese to start to brown around the edges.</li>
            <li>Allow pizza to sit at rest for at least 5 minutes to allow the toppings to properly set, and then slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
